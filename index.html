				<h5 class="milli"> Who Am I? </h5>
					<p>I am a west coast girl. Open spaces and mountain ranges make me happy. I love people; especially the ones who are insanely passionate about what they do. I’m a designer, explorer, connector and athlete. I’m crazy about life and plan to live a remarkable one. So far the experience has been pretty awesome. </p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="two">
				<h5 class="milli"> What am I doing?</h5>
					<p>I’m doing what I am good at. Math and science didn’t make sense but negative space did. I love working with type and photography especially in print media. I also experiment with interface design some web and animation. 
		</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="three">
				<h5 class="milli"> Why am I doing it? </h5>
					<p>Because design is about people. People who love to create, to live and to explore. People who are passionate about life, beauty and curiosity. These are the people I want to work with, learn from and inspire.</p>

				<h5 class="milli"> The Story </h5>
					<p> No Pain, No Gain. This is every athletes mantra as they brush off an injury and hit the field again. No where is this more true than in Women's Rugby. The heart of these women for their sport is incredibly inspiring. They sacrifice their bodies, their time and their money in order to play the sport they love. </p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="text-thirds text-thirds-left">
				<h5 class="milli"> The Problem </h5>
					<p>Rugby as a sport is breaking ground world wide. However, as with all sports the women’s division remains a sub category. Possibly the most dedicated people I know, the women I play with are the most inspiring people I have ever worked with. On or off the field. I wanted to shine a light on their heart for the game and how women have impacted Rugby. 
</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="text-thirds">
				<h5 class="milli"> The Solution</h5>
					<p>Social Media is a daily source of inspiration and information. Hashtags have become a way to connect vast amounts of content and synthesize topics. Keeping this in mind I designed a series of motivational posters under the hashtag "womensrugby". This movement can be transferred to a broad stream of media outlets. The quotes are easily applicable to things like apparel, and merchandise. </p>

			<h2>Merry Christmas from Target</h2>
			<h4 class="brand-color">Branding</h4>
			
		<div class="text">
			<div class="text-thirds text-thirds-left">
				<h5 class="milli"> The Story </h5>
				<p> I love Target. It's kind of lame but it is quickly becoming one of my favourite stores. They have just about everything a person could immediatly need. It's the perfect store for meandering if you have time to kill. The aisle's are wide, bright and clean and the staff doesn't tend to bug you to much. </p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="text-thirds text-thirds-left">
				<h5 class="milli"> The Problem </h5>
				<p>Target Canada depends to much on their status in the U.S to appeal to their new clientel. Unfortunatley they just don't offer the same value and their market is different. In Canada, winter isn't just a season but a way of life that must be embraced. Target needs to step into that market in order to be successful in the Great North. </p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="text-thirds">
				<h5 class="milli"> The Solution</h5>
				<p>The Merry Christmas campaign was created. Using Target's existing colours but adding a homey element with creative type they introduced their winter collection. Playing off of old Christmas songs, and lines like "Baby it's cold outsdie," they invited clientele in to experience the warmth of the Target Shopping experience. Free cocoa upon arrival and blissful warmth of a store's interior.</p>

			<h5 class="milli"> The Story </h5>
				<p>Your wife, mother, father, siter, brother, or partner walks into the room. There you are, working contentedly on whatever happens to be in front of you. Suddenly, with one little question they have utterly disturbed your peace of mind and leave you longing for the simpler moments before they walked into the room. What is this question? Read on. </p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="text-thirds text-thirds-left">
			<h5 class="milli"> The Problem </h5>
				<p>Everyone is familiar with the age old question, "what would you like to eat?" Some people have an immediate answer, but most are plagued with indecision or indifference. Food in front of them would be nice, how it gets there is of secondary interest.
				</p>
			</div>
	
			<div class="text-thirds">
			<h5 class="milli"> The Solution </h5>
				<p>An app of course! Because in this digital age your phone should be able to do everything, including deciding what you are going to eat. Eat, is recipe collective. Users can add their own recipes, or search through a pre-loaded collection of declicious meals. However the app's primary feature is it's random idea generator. Based on the time of day it will provide you with scrumptios meal ideas you can cook at home.

				<h5 class="milli"> The Story </h5>
					<p> MyChurch is a young church growing under the guidance of pastors Caleb and Julie Davidson. They and their leadership team have a strong belief in the power of media to deliver a message. Their creative team is huge part of what they do within their culture. I recently joined their graphics team, with a strong focus on providing graphics for events. </p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="text-thirds text-thirds-left">
				<h5 class="milli"> The Problem </h5>
					<p>MyChurch is typically focused on reaching university aged students. People between 18 and 25 make up the majority of the church body. Information and content has to be brief, eye-catching and direct. It also needs to be appealing to those beyond the church. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="text-thirds">
				<h5 class="milli"> The Solution </h5>
					<p>Instagraphics were a quick, powerful solution. They were easy to update, tag and share across multiple platforms and with multiple generations. I designed several versions of graphics for a variety of events. These were released each week and continuously require updating and redesign.</p>

			<h2>Sisterhood</h2>
			<h4 class="brand-color">Branding</h4>
	
		<div class="text">
			<div class="text-thirds text-thirds-left">
				<h5 class="milli"> The Story </h5>
					<p> A passion project that started with Julie Davidson, a pastor at MyChurch, Sisterhood is a movement designed to inspire and empower women. City wide Sisterhood conferences are held 3-4 times a year. Each conference is given it’s own label and branding identity specific to the event. </p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="text-thirds text-thirds-left">
				<h5 class="milli"> The Problem </h5>
				<p>I was approached to design a logo type for the Sisterhood brand as well as a look for the next conference, “United”. It needed to be colourful and girly without being cliche. They wanted something that would be applicable across multiple platforms, including video. </p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="text-thirds">
				<h5 class="milli"> The Solution </h5>
				<p>Given the organic and inspirational focus of Sisterhood, the hand lettered logotype seemed appropriate. Strong but feminine it would be easy to partner with alternate brand looks. The United needed to have some of the same organic feel. A watercolour effect and some photoshop brushes helped to customize the standard text and tie in the Sisterhood logo. </p>

			<h2>365 Series</h2>
			<h4 class="brand-color">Typography</h4>
		<div class="text">
			<div class="text-thirds text-thirds-left">
				<h5 class="milli"> The Story</h5>
					<p>Instagram and tumblr are hugely popular platforms for designers. I was inspired by artists who used these networks to share their work and create amazing series. I decided to take the plunge and do the same. A 365 day lettering projects seemed to be the perfect blend of two of my passions. Typography and photography.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="text-thirds text-thirds-left">
				<h5 class="milli"> The Problem </h5>
					<p>In the past couple of years I find I often lose my excitement for my work in the midst of homework assignments. These were projects I had to do and they were the same ones everyone else was doing. I needed something to help me grow my skill set, and regenerate my creative energies. Embarking on this project has been a growing experience and just a lot of fun. </p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="text-thirds">
				<h5 class="milli"> The Solution </h5>
					<p>Perusing pinterest, instagram and tumblr provided a wealth of inspiration for experimental fonts and letter choices. Inspiration was everywhere, in movies, the credits from old disney classics and in books and magazines. The series has grown, and is deepening as a collection of words that inspire me, make me laugh or just look really cool. Eventually prints and cards would be an awesome way to expand and experiment.</p>

			<div class="text-thirds text-thirds-left">
				<h5 class="milli"> The Problem </h5>
					<p>I had albums and albums of photos with blurry faces, bad light, awkwardly posed subjects and out of focus objects.

I wanted to be able to take picture that captured joy, humour, and a random assortment of other emotions. </p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="text-thirds">
				<h5 class="milli">The Solution</h5>
					<p>I needed to learn to take a decent photograph, and learn how to edit. I’ve taken hundreds and hundreds of photographs. Some worth sharing and some that should never be seen by other people. I offered to do shoots for friends and I took my camera with me everywhere. I read articles, books and lists on tips, tricks and techniues.

			<h2>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</h2>
			<h4 class="brand-color">Poster Design</h4>
		
		<div class="text">
			<div class="text-thirds text-thirds-left">
				<h5 class="milli"> The Story </h5>
					<p>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, is an amazing movie. Totally quirky and definitely awesome it combines music, typography, humour, and cinematography in a heart warming blend of self discovery and exploration. The story line is slightly ridiculous, but it speaks to the explorer's heart in me. </p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="text-thirds text-thirds-left">
				<h5 class="milli">The Problem</h5>
					<p>“Design a movie poster” That was it, that was the assignment. It could be any movie. The only guide lines were, it had to be simple and reduce the movie to it’s basic components. I went through 8 different movies before I settled on The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.</p>
			</div>
		
			<div class="text-thirds">
				<h5 class="milli">The Solution </h5>
					<p>Recently my work has been very much photography based. I wanted to expand and try something new. I took an illustrative approach and broke down one of the pivotal scenes in the movie. The scene is the first time that Walter Mitty does something adventurous. It wasn’t the most sensible leap, but he jumped and that pretty much summed up the movie. I added some texture in photoshop, and overlayed a map look to show the travel that takes place in the movive. </p>

			<h2>Luke's Diner</h2>
			<h4 class="brand-color">Branding</h4>
		<div class="text">
			<div class="text-thirds text-thirds-left">
				<h5 class="milli"> The Story</h5>
					<p> There are three things I really like. Food, design and Netflix. One of my recent show's involved a diner called Luke's. It's tacky and cliche and exactly the sort of place you wished really existed. At one point the in the show the diner was destroyed and required a remodel. They didn't change anything about it in the show but it got me thinking about how would I rebrand it? </p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="text-thirds text-thirds-left">
				<h5 class="milli"> The Problem </h5>
					<p>The original diner look was very cliche, it had a red and yellow sign in the shape of a coffee cup with the word Luke's on it. In recent years, cafe's and diners have been getting updated looks that are very modern and trendy. I wanted to do something similar in order to keep it relevant but something retained a bit of the diner character.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="text-thirds">
				<h5 class="milli"> The Solution</h5>
					<p>The design concept I came up with took a patriotic turn with a red, white and blue colour theme. It seemed appropriate considering the cultural background of diner's. A simple logo became the focal point. Quirky, original icons were made to match, a collection of cooking utensils commonly found in any kitchen added detail and provided the building blocks for multiple elements. Simply rearranging the icons into various patterns could be transferred to takeout labels and containers, menu's, glass ware, paper ware and other branding materials.   </p>
